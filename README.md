# importDataFromExcelFilesToMysql
##Specific Requirement
There are about 2000 such folders and we want to have a Python program to get the import done automatically.

Each of the Excel contains one table and we want to import and store every one of them as a separate table in MySQL.

All columns of data are needed.

The first row “Monitor: 821 (12/19/13 - 11/27/15)” will be removed and one column named “at_company” will be added and the variable value is 821.
##Tips
You should modify the code for your own requirements.

(1) What table names to be created

(2) How to process the files' name

(3) The details when creating a table
