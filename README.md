# importDataFromExcelFilesToMysql
##Specific Requirement
There are many folders and we want to have a Python program to get the import done automatically.

Each of the Excel contains one table and we want to import and store every one of them as a separate table in MySQL.

All columns of data are needed.

The first row “Monitor: 123 ...” will be removed and one column named “firm” will be added and the variable value is 123.
##Tips
You should modify the code for your own requirements.

(2) How to process the files' name
